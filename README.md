## Introduction

MutaPipe is a fast and efficient bioinformatics pipeline to screen the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/) for genes of interest and retrieve the highest quality protein structures (best resolution) for each unique sequence associated with a gene. Additionally, whenever corresponding data is available, variants will be annotated using information on variant pathogenicity from [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/intro/).

This allows researchers to efficiently screen the PDB for the most suitable template structures for a specific WT or mutant gene/protein, which can then be used for further in silico analysis such as homology modeling, mutagenesis experiments or molecular dynamics simulations.

**Figure 1.** Pipeline overview. MutaPipe takes a list of gene names as input. The pipeline firstly performs a search of the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB) and retrieves information on all available protein structures associated with the input genes (and the species: Homo sapiens). Subsequently, a BLASTp against the canonical protein reference sequence (obtained from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)) is performed for each identified PDB sequence. The BLASTp alignment is used to identify mismatches, including single amino variants (SAVs), in the amino acid sequence of the PDB structures relative to the canonical sequence. Next, the data is filtered and rearranged to output a table listing the *n* highest quality structures for all available sequences in the PDB which are associated with the input genes. Additionally, if a given amino acid change has corresponding variant data in ClinVar, this information will be added to the output table.

## Documentation

### Workflow 

MutaPipe uses the inputted gene names to find all associated PDB IDs (using the PDB API) and downloads all corresponding `fasta`, `mmCif`, and `pdb` files for further anaylses (will require disk space depending on the number and size of the available structures).
In a next step, MutaPipe parses all the downloaded files and combines all relevant information (e.g. resolution, sequence, unsolved residues in PDB structures). Subsequently, MutaPipe accessess the canonical protein sequences for all input genes (from the UniProt fasta file) and uses *BLASTp* (e-value threshold: .05) to identify all mismatches, incl. SAVs, available in the identified PDB structures. *BLASTp* is performed separately for every sequence in every structure against the UniProt reference sequence for the input gene associated with this structure (e.g. *BLASTp* of all sequences in a given *FUS* structure against the canonical protein sequence for *FUS*). The `.xml` output files generated by *BLASTp* are parsed and used to extract information, incl.: e-value, bit, alignment length, mismatches, close mismatches, gaps, indels. This information will be used by MutaPipe to identify all unique sequences in the PDB which are associated with the input genes and subsequently get the best n structures (the ones with the highest resolution) for each of these sequences. 

MutaPipe achieves this by sorting the data to get:
- all available wildtype (WT) structures for the input genes
- the best *n* structures per SAV (structures with only this one amino acid change/mutation and no other amino acid changes/mutations)
- the best *n* structures per unique sequence/combination of mutations available in the PDB (including WT/no mutation)
- the best *n* structures for any specific mutation, regardless of other mutations in the same structure

Finally, whenever corresponding data is available, MutaPipe will annotate variants using variant information from ClinVar, incl. information on variant pathogenicity.

**Filtering** <br />
To ensure sequences not associated with the gene of interest which are present in a PDB structure (e.g. if a protein of interest is co-crystallised with another peptide) do not get included in the final output, MutaPipe also has an additional step to filter out sequences:
1. which are shorter than a given percentage of the reference sequence (set variable relative_sequence_length; default value = 0.5)
2. whose best High Scoring Segment Pair (HSP) covers less than a given percentage of the reference sequence (set variable hsp_coverage; default value = 0.1) *(***Note***: A high-scoring segment pair, or HSP, is a subsegment of a pair of sequences, either nucleotide or amino acid, that share high level of similarity. The level of similarity between the sequences depends on the settings of the local or global alignment algorithm which generated them.)*

### Minimum Requirements

- stable internet connection
- python > 3.6.8
	- Biopython
- NCBI BLAST+
- RAM: >16GB)
- Space required by the installation: 36 MB
- Scratch space for usage: depends the number and and size of PDB structures associated with the input genes. *NOTE: To check how many structures are available for your genes of interest, run the command `python3 00_search_pdb.py -g GENES_OF_INTEREST`. This will generate console output as well as csv files both of which provide an overview of how many structures have been identified for your input genes.*

### Local Deployment

To obtain MutaPipe please use git to download the most recent development tree:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Utilon/MutaPipe_Repo.git
```
#### NOTE: Reference Proteome Required (default version included in MutaPipe)
In order to run MutaPipe a fasta file containing the reference proteome / canonical protein sequences for the organism in question (= Homo sapiens) will have to be downloaded from UniProt and stored in a folder called `Uniprot_reference_seqs` in the `MutaPipe` directory (where the python scripts are stored). The filename should be `UP000005640_9606.fasta` for the script to work properly.
The latest version of this fasta file can be accessed via the [UniProt ftp client](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/Eukaryota/UP000005640/).

**NOTE**: When installing MutaPipe a fasta file of the reference proteome for Homo sapiens will be included (version from December 2021). Please feel free to update to a newer version if one is available (we will also regularly update the reference proteome file on here, but this is currently not done automatically).


### Usage

MutaPipe can be run in two different ways (from within the `MutaPipe` directory):
1. Using the bash script `MutaPipe.sh`
2. Using the MutaPipe python scripts individually

#### Using the bash script

MutaPipe can be run using the bash script `MutaPipe.sh`. MutaPipe.sh executes all python scripts incorporated in the pipeline one after another. (If instead you wish to run any of the pipeline stages separately, please follow the instructions further [below](#Using-the-python-scripts)). 

**All arguments for the MutaPipe.sh script are OPTIONAL.** The script has preset default values, i.e. it can be run *without* setting any of the available flags. To view the default values set in MutaPipe.sh, use the command `./MutaPipe.sh -h`.

```bash

  Usage: [-h|l|t|g|o|a|f|p|d|b|u|r|c|n]
   
  General options:
  -h	HELP				Print this help message and exit
  -l	LOG				Write console output to log file in target directory if set to True. Default = False
  -t	TARGET_DIRECTORY  		Specify target directory where output will be stored. Default = current_working_directory
  
  MutaPipe options:
  -g	GENES				Specify genes of interest. To to pass a file containing all gene names use -g \$(cat filename). Default = ['OPTN', 'ERBB4', 'DCTN1']
  -o	ORGANISM			Set species for which to search pdb structures. Default = Homo sapiens
  -a	ALL_PDB_IDS		    	Specify whether to retrieve all (True) or max. 10 PDB IDs (False) per gene. Default = True
  -f	FORMAT			  	Specify file formats to download. Default = [cif pdb fasta]. Options = [cif pdb fasta]
  -p	POLYPEPTIDES			Specify whether to extract polypeptide sequence (True) or not (False). Default = True
  -d    DELETE_FILES   		     	  Specify whether to delete mmCIF, pdb and fasta files after parsing (True) or not (False). Default = True
  -b	BLASTp_PATH			Set path to blastp on your system. Default = blastp
  -u	UNIPROT_REFSEQS			Set path to reference proteome fasta file. Default = MutaPipe_Repo/MutaPipe/Uniprot_reference_seqs/
  -r	RELATIVE_SEQUENCE_LENGTH	Set to filter out sequences shorter than a given percentage of the reference sequence (0.1-1.0). Default = 0.5
  -c	HSP_COVERAGE			Set to filter out sequences whose best hsp covers less than a given percentage of the reference sequence (0.1-1.0). Default = 0.1   
  -n    N_BEST_STRUCTURES  		   Set number of best structures to be listed in output for each sequence/variant. Default =

```

##### Usage example bash

To run MutaPipe for gene NEK1 and set the paramaters to filter out
1. sequences shorter than 70% of the reference sequence and 
2. sequences whose best HSP covers less than 30% of the reference sequence, 
use the command:

```bash
./MutaPipe.sh -g NEK1 -r 0.7 -c 0.3
```

To run MutaPipe with **more than one input gene**, e.g. for NEK1 and SOD1, and the same parameters as before, use the command:
```bash
./MutaPipe.sh -g "NEK1 SOD1" -r 0.7 -c 0.3
```

To run MutaPipe passing a file containing the genes of interest, e.g. this example file called [genes.txt](https://github.com/Utilon/MutaPipe_Repo/blob/main/MutaPipe/genes.txt), and the same parameters as before, use the command:
```bash
./MutaPipe.sh -g $(cat genes.txt) -r 0.7 -c 0.3
```

#### Using the python scripts 

MutaPipe can be run manually, by running the 8 python scripts one after another (script [`00`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/00_search_pdb.py), [`01`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/01_download_files.py), [`02`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/02_parse_cif_files.py), [`03`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py), [`04`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/04_parse_fasta_files.py), [`05`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/05_blast_against_reference.py), [`06_a`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/06_a_download_ClinVar_data.py), [`06_b`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/06_b_parse_ClinVar_data.py), [`07`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py)). Use the `-h` flag on any MutaPipe python script to see instructions and available arguments (e.g. use the command: `python3 script_name -h`).

**All arguments for the MutaPipe python scripts are OPTIONAL.** The scripts have preset default values, i.e. they can be run *without* setting any of the available flags. To view the default values set in each MutaPipe python script, use the command `python3 script_name -h`.

**Script dependencies:** Although the scripts can be run individually, they mostly require at least some output from previous scripts in the pipeline. The table below lists the script dependencies in more detail:

```diff
+Table to be added here
```

The following options are available for all the MutaPipe python scripts:

```bash
-h, --help		show help message and exit
-l, --log		write console output to log file in current directory if set to True, default = False
-t, --target		specify target directory, default = current_working_directory
```

Moreover, additional arguments can be set during different stages of MutaPipe:
 ```bash
# additional arguments for script 00_search_pdb.py
-g, --genes		Specify genes for which to search pdb structures, default = ['OPTN', 'ERBB4', 'DCTN1']; to pass a file containing all genes use -g $(cat filename)
-o, --organism		Specify species for which to search pdb structures, default = Homo sapiens
-a, --all		Retrieve all (True) vs max. 10 pdb IDs per gene (False), default = True

# additional arguments for script 01_download_files.py
-f, --format		Specify file format to be downloaded. For mmCif files (.cif) use 'cif' ; for pdb files (.pdb) use 'pdb' ; for fasta files (.fasta) use 'fasta' ; default = cif pdb fasta

# additional arguments for script 02_parse_cif_files.py
-pp, --polypeptides	Specify whether to extract polypeptide sequence (True) or not (False), default = True
-del, --delete_files Specify whether to delete mmCIF files after parsing (True) or not (False), default = True

# additional arguments for script 03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py
-del, --delete_files Specify whether to delete mmCIF files after parsing (True) or not (False), default = True

# additional arguments for script 04_parse_fasta_files.py
-del, --delete_files Specify whether to delete mmCIF files after parsing (True) or not (False), default = True

# additional arguments for script 05_blast_against_reference.py
-bp, --blastp_path		Specify the path to blastp on your system ; default = blastp       
-refseq, --reference_sequences	Specify path to uniprot reference fasta, default = MutaPipe_Repo/MutaPipe/Uniprot_reference_seqs/UP000005640_9606.fasta    

# additional arguments for script 07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py
-rsl, --relative_sequence_length	filter out sequences shorter than a given percentage of the reference sequence, default = 0.5
-cov, --hsp_coverage			filter out sequences whose best HSP covers less than a given percentage of the reference sequence, default = 0.1
-n_best, --n_best_structures	Specify number of top structures per sequence/variant to be included in final output, default = 5
```

##### Usage example python

Let's assume we want to run MutaPipe for the genes *SOD1*, *ERBB4*, and *DCTN1* using the python scripts one after another, so we have more direct control over the options at each stage of the pipeline.

Our genes of interest for this example are stored in a file called [`genes.txt`](https://github.com/Utilon/MutaPipe_Repo/blob/main/MutaPipe/genes.txt)

Using the first MutaPipe python script [`00_search_pdb.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/00_search_pdb.py) and the `-g` flag, we can search the PDB for structures associated with our genes of interest. Let's assume we also want to restrict our search to only retrieve max. 10 PDB ID's per input gene. We can do this by setting the `-a` flag to False.
```bash
python3 00_search_pdb.py -g $(cat genes.txt) -a False
```

The output files generated by `00_search_pdb.py` reveal that there are PDB structures for all our genes of interest. More specifically, our search retrieved:
1. 10 PDB IDs for *SOD1* (setting `-a` to True results in 127 PDB ID's)
2. 10 PDB IDs for *ERBB4*
3. 9 PDB IDs for *DCTN1*

Next, we use the scipt [`01_download_files.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/01_download_files.py) to download all relevant mmCif, pdb, and fasta files (for the PDB IDs identified in the previous step). While we could use the `-f`flag here to specify the desired file format to be downloaded, we don't set the flag as the default option (set to download mmCif, pdb, and fasta files) is required to run the full MutaPipe pipeline. Changing the file format to be downloaded is not recommended unless the rest one doesn't intend to run the rest of the pipeline - Remember that a complete MutaPipe run always requires downloading all three file formats (mmCif, pdb, fasta).
```bash
python3 01_download_files.py
```
Looking at our Results directory, we now see a new subfolder for each of our input genes (*SOD1*, *ERBB4*, and *DCTN1*) which contains all associated files retrieved from the PDB for this gene (mmCif, pdb, fasta). 

Now we are going to parse the downloaded mmCif files using the script [`02_parse_cif_files.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/02_parse_cif_files.py). We can set the flag `-pp` to True or False to indicate whether we want to also extract the polypeptide sequences from the mmCif files or not. The polypeptide sequences are continuous chains of amino acids without any missing residues in the crystal structure (comparable to how the sequence is shown in PyMOL). It is not required to extract the polypeptide sequences for MutaPipe to run, so let's set the `-pp`flag to False:
```bash
python3 02_parse_cif_files.py -pp False
```
The output files generated by `02_parse_cif_files.py` list important information on all the structures, including structure name, resolution, structure method, deposition date, and classification.

In a next step, we use script [`03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py) to extract all unsolved residues in each crystall structure from the previously downloaded pdb files.
```bash
python3 03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py
```
The output files generated by `python3 03_parse_pdb_files_extract_unsolved_residues.py` provide an overview of all unsolved residues per structure and per chain. Unresolved/missing residues are amino acids which are absent in the crystall structure (no atomic coordinates available).

Next, we are going to use the script [`04_parse_fasta_files.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/04_parse_fasta_files.py) to parse the downloaded fasta files as well as the fasta files created from the mmCif files (all in format \_ex.fasta).
```bash
python3 04_parse_fasta_files.py
```
The output files generated by `python3 04_parse_fasta_files.py` list important information on all the sequences/chains in each fasta file, including chain name, UniProt ID, description, species, and amino acid sequence.

Now that all the files have been parsed, we can use the script [`05_blast_against_reference.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/05_blast_against_reference.py) to perform *BLASTp*. The script will perform a *BLASTp* for every sequence in every structure associated with our input genes against the corresponding reference sequence. By default, the reference sequence for each of our input genes will be retrieved from the UniProt fasta file containing the human reference proteome called [`UP000005640_9606.fasta`](https://github.com/Utilon/MutaPipe_Repo/blob/main/MutaPipe/Uniprot_reference_seqs/UP000005640_9606.fasta) which is included in MutaPipe (version December 2021; see instructions on how to download the latest version of this file [here](#How-to-Download-the-Reference-Proteome)). If we wanted to use a different file, we could set the `-refseq` flag and specify the path to the fasta file containing the reference proteome we'd like to use. 
```bash
python3 05_blast_against_reference.py
```
Looking at our Results directory, we can now see that a new subdirectory called `RefSeqs` has been created. It contains the canonical amino acid sequences for all of our input genes (*SOD1*, *ERBB4*, and *DCTN1*) as well as a subdirectory called `PDB_seqs_and_blastp_outputs` where all the PDB sequences used as query sequences in the *BLASTp* are stored in fasta format, and their corresponding blastp output files are stored in xml format. 

Moreover, the output files generated by script `05_blast_against_reference.py` nicely summarise all *BLASTp* results. Note that there are two files containing potential warnings: One in case no or more than one reference sequence is identified for an input gene and one in case *BLASTp* fails or does not produce any significant alignements. In our case 3 warnings for the gene *DCTN1* have been produced, namely:
1. No alignments for `DCTN1_2hl3_ChainC.fasta`
2. No alignments for `DCTN1_2hqh_ChainsE,F,G,H.fasta`
3. No alignments for `DCTN1_3e2u_ChainsE,F,G,H.fasta`
To investigate potential reasons for why there were no alignments for these sequences, we can have a look at these sequences in the output file called `05_blastp_results.csv`. In our case, we can infer that the warnings have been generated because the sequences in question are actually not *DCTN1* sequences, but are other protein sequences which happen to be also present in/co-crystallised with a PDB structure associated with our input genes. The sequences which produced warnings in our case are not *DCTN1* sequences, but are instead (1) Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1, (2) Restin, and (3) CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1.

The next two steps consist of downloading and parsing ClinVar annotations for all variants of our genes of interest. This information is used to annotate all variants available in the identified PDB sequences for the genes of interest. The script [`06_a_download_ClinVar_data.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/06_a_download_ClinVar_data.py) incorporates [Entrez Direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) to access ClinVar and download data on all variant ids associated with our input genes. Subsequently, script [`06_b_parse_ClinVar_data.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/06_b_parse_ClinVar_data.py) will parse the data downloaded from ClinVar. 
```bash
python3 06_a_download_ClinVar_data.py
python3 06_b_parse_ClinVar_data.py
```

Script `06_a_download_ClinVar_data.py` produces a file called `06_a_ClinVar_Annotations_genes_no_data_retrieved.txt` which contains a list of all genes for which no data has been retrieved from ClinVar. Script `06_b_parse_ClinVar_data.py` generates a table called `06_b_ClinVar_Annotations.csv` with information on all variants in ClinVar associated with our input genes.

Finally, the last script [`07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py`](https://github.com/Utilon/Pipeline_Git/blob/main/MutaPipe/07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py) will combine the data from ClinVar, the PDB and the BLASTp results, and subsequently, filter, rearrange and order it to get the *n* best structures for each variant/sequence. 

Here we can filter out:
1. sequences which are considered too short (compared to the reference sequence) to be valuable template structures. We can use the relative sequence length flag `-rsl` to set this value (0.1-1.0).
2. sequences whose best High Scoring Segment Pair (HSP) covers less than a given percentage of the reference sequence. We can use the hsp coverage flag `-cov` to set this value (0.1-1.0). *(***Note***: A high-scoring segment pair, or HSP, is a subsegment of a pair of sequences, either nucleotide or amino acid, that share high level of similarity. The level of similarity between the sequences depends on the settings of the local or global alignment algorithm which generated them.)* <br />

For our example we'll stick to the default settings which are `-rsl 0.5` and `-cov 0.1`, so we don't have to set the flags.
```bash
python3 07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py
```

Script `07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py` produces a file called `07_wildtype_structures.csv` which contains all available WT structures associated with the input genes (top row = highest quality structure). 
The other 3 csv output files generated by `script 07_combine_data_to_get_best_n_structures_per_sequence.py` neatly list the *n* best PDB structures for each sequence/variant available in the PDB which is associated with our input genes:
* The best structures for all SAVs are contained in `07_best_structures_per_SAV.csv`
* The best structures for all unique sequences associated with the input genes are contained in `07_best_structures_all_unique_combinations.csv`
* The best structures for any available variant/amino acid change in the PDB regardless of other variants/AA changes in the same structure are contained in `07_best_structures_any_mutation.csv`


### Output

MutaPipe creates a directory called `Results` where all intermediary and final main output files are stored (*Note:* the `-t` flag lets you specify where you'd like this folder to be created, default = current working directory). All relevant files and data retrieved or extracted from the reference proteome fasta file, the ClinVar database, and the PDB are stored in additional subdirectories in the `Results` directory called `ClinVar_Annotations`, `RefSeqs`, and `[GENENAME]_[n]structures` (see [Figure 3](#ouput-example) below for an example).

Each of the eigth python scripts incorporated in MutaPipe produces at least one main output file which will be stored directly in the `Results` directory. *NOTE:* All MutaPipe output filenames start with the numerical identifier of the corresponding MutaPipe script, making it easy to understand which outputs have been generated at which stage of the pipeline.

After a complete MutaPipe run with the default settings the following main output files are stored in the `Results` directory:

```bash
- 00_search_overview_availability.csv 			* lists all input genes with a boolean value indicating whether corresponding PDB data exists
- 00_search_overview_PDBids.csv 			* lists all input genes with available PDB data and their corresponding PDB IDs
- 01_search_overview_folders.csv 			* lists all newly created directories (on for each input gene with available PDB data) and their content
- 01_search_overview_n_structures.csv 			* lists number of structures retrieved per gene (simple overview)
- 02_all_poly_seq.csv 					* lists polypeptide sequences for all PDB structures associated with the input genes
- 02_all_resolutions.csv 				* lists resolutions for all PDB structures associated with the input genes
- 03_unsolved_residues_per_chain.csv 	* lists all unsolved residues in all chains of all PDB structures for all genes (one row for each chain)
- 03_unsolved_residues_per_structure.csv 	* lists all unsolved residues in all PDB structures for all genes (one row for each structure)
- 04_fasta_combined_info.csv 				* lists combined information extracted from all fasta and fasta_ex files for all available sequences in the PDB associated with the input genes
- 04_fasta_info.csv 					* lists information extracted from all fasta files (downloaded from PDB) for all available sequences in the PDB associated with the input genes
- 04_fasta_ex_info.csv 					* lists information extracted from all _ex.fasta files (extracted from mmCif files) for all available sequences in the PDB associated with the input genes
- 05_blastp_results.csv 				* lists all the information in 04_fasta_combined_info.csv and the corresponding blastp results for every sequence
- 05_blastp_warnings.csv 				* lists blastp warnings (if blastp failed or if there is more than one alignment)
- 05_refeseq_warnings.csv 				* lists genes with no or more than one identified reference sequence (only first one is used for further analyses)
- 06_a_ClinVar_Annotations_genes_no_data_retrieved.txt 	* lists all genes for which no ClinVar annotations could be retrieved
- 06_b_ClinVar_Annotations.csv 					* lists all variants availalbe in ClinVar and their annotations for the input genes
- 07_best_structures_all_unique_combinations.csv 	* lists best structure for all unique mismatch combinations for all input genes, incl. ClinVar annotations
- 07_best_structures_any_mutation.csv 		* lists best structure for any mismatch regardless of other mismatches in the same structure for all input genes, incl. ClinVar annotations
- 07_best_structures_per_SAV.csv 		* lists best structure for each SAV (one mutation per structure) for all input genes, incl. ClinVar annotations
- 07_wildtype_structures.csv 			* lists all available WT structures for all input genes
```

To avoid cluttering the directory containing the main output files, MutaPipe creates subfolders in the `Results` directory where it stores any additional files and relevant data retrieved or extracted from the reference proteome fasta files, the ClinVar database, and the PDB. 

*Note:* For each input gene with available PDB data, MutaPipe creates a subdirectory containing (1) data from the PDB retrieved via the PDB API (i.e. the corresponding mmCif, fasta, and pdb files) as well as (2) gene-specific output files generated at different steps in the pipeline. 

MutaPipe creates the following subdirectories in `Results`:

```bash
- ClinVar_Annotations 			* subdirectory where all ClinVar data is stored
- RefSeqs 				* subdirectory where all the reference sequences and other files used/generated by BLASTp are stored
- [GENENAME]_[n]structures 		* subdirectory for each input gene where all corresponding data from the PDB as well as gene-specific output files are stored
```

```diff
+NOTE: A section explaining all columns in main output files will be added shortly!
```

#### Ouput example

Let's assume we want to get the best PDB structures for all availbale NEK1-related sequences in the PDB. We stick to the default settings and thus use the following command to obtain results:
```bash
./MutaPipe.sh -g NEK1
```

Consequently, we see that a new folder called `Results` has been created in our current working directory. It includes all the main output files as well as three additional subdirectories called `ClinVar_Annotations`, `RefSeqs`, and `NEK1_2structures`.

### How to Download the Reference Proteome

MutaPipe will need a fasta file with all canonical protein sequences of the species of interest.

In order to run MutaPipe a fasta file containing the reference proteome / canonical protein sequences for the organism in question (= Homo sapiens) will have to be downloaded from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) and stored in a folder called `Uniprot_reference_seqs` in the `MutaPipe` directory (where the python scripts are stored). The filename should be `UP000005640_9606.fasta` for the script to work properly.
The latest version of this fasta file can be accessed via the [UniProt ftp client](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/Eukaryota/UP000005640/).


**NOTE**: When installing MutaPipe (see [Local Deployment](#local-deployment)) a fasta file of the reference proteome for Homo sapiens will be included (version from December 2021). Please feel free to update to a newer version if one is available (we will also regularly update the reference proteome file on here, but this is currently not done automatically).
